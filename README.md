===========

Some public domain art and code I made while getting back into LibGDX/flixel-android. Includes a fox, a hunter, a pheasant and a rabbit. The code wraps it up into a forest-y scene inspired by a photograph I saw at the Wildlife Photographer of the Year Award 2011.

Some animations included. Nothing special. Code and art are licensed under the Do What The Fudge You Want license. Sound effects are from freesound and libraries are LibGDX and flixel-android's, and not my own, obviously.
